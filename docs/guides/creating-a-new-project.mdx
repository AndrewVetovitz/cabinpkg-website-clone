You can use Poac to create a new project and install dependencies.

```bash
$ poac new hello_world
     Created binary (application) `hello_world` package
```

> If you want to integrate your existing project with Poac, use the `init` command:
>
> ```bash
> your-pj/$ poac init
>      Created binary (application) `your-pj` package
> ```
>
> This command just creates a `poac.toml` file not to let your project break.
