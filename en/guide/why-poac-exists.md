## Why Poac Exists

I often see that C++ was said to be a difficult language, and I saw many people who shun it just because of C++.
It was thought that it is hard to construct an environment, there is no definitive package manager, and the strange syntax of the build system [CMake](https://cmake.org), etc. is the cause that makes us feel hesitant.

By developing a package manager and build system that has an intuitive and easy-to-use interface like [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) and [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo), and users can develop applications and libraries without being aware of CMake, you can focus on learning C++ without being stumble.
I also plan to implement integration with many other build systems and package managers, so you should be able to switch seamlessly.
