You can use Poac to create a new project and install dependencies.

```bash
$ poac new hello_world
     Created binary (application) `hello_world` package
```

> If you want to integrate your existing project with Poac, use the `init` command:
>
> ```bash
> your-pj/$ poac init
>      Created binary (application) `your-pj` package
> ```
>
> This command just creates a `poac.toml` file not to let your project break.

### Install dependencies

Like Cargo does, Poac installs dependencies at build time.  Poac currently supports Git and system dependencies.  You can specify dependencies like:

`poac.toml`

```toml
[dependencies]
"ToruNiina/toml11" = { git = "https://github.com/ToruNiina/toml11.git", rev = "846abd9a49082fe51440aa07005c360f13a67bbf" }
```

After editing `poac.toml`, executing the `build` command will install the package and its dependencies.

```console
you:~/hello_world$ poac build
Downloaded ToruNiina/toml11 846abd9a49082fe51440aa07005c360f13a67bbf
 Compiling src/main.cc
   Linking hello_world
  Finished debug target(s) in 0.70s
```

To use system dependencies, use `system = true`:

`poac.toml`

```toml
[dependencies]
libgit2 = { version = "1.1.0", system = true }
```

The dependency name should be acceptable by `pkg-config`.  The version requirement syntax is specified in [src/VersionReq.hpp](https://github.com/poac-dev/poac/blob/main/src/VersionReq.hpp).

> [!WARNING]
> Poac currently supports building a project with header-only dependencies.
> Building with build-required dependencies will be soon supported.
