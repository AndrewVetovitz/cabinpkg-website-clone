## Why Poac Exists

C++ is often considered to be a complicated language and shunned unconsciously by most people.
It is thought that it is hard to construct a C++ environment, no definitive package manager, and the strange syntax of build systems such as [CMake](https://cmake.org) make us feel hesitant.

By developing a package manager and build system, which have an intuitively easy-to-use interface like [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) and [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo) and make users be able to develop applications and libraries without being aware of [CMake](https://cmake.org), developers will be able to focus on learning C++ without stumbling.
I also plan to implement integration with many other build systems and package managers so that you can seamlessly switch a development environment.

### Naming Background

Poac is originated from `cpp` but also designed to emphasize ease of typing and avoiding the burden being placed on only one hand as Poac will be entered many times as a command.
The ergonomically optimized name prevents you from leading to tenosynovitis.

As I mentioned before, C++ is often avoided being selected for product development; however, I would like to disseminate C++ as a fun language through Poac.
Amemiya and Mizutani argue that the `/p/` sound gives the brightest and softest impression (157).[^1]
Accordingly, I believe Poac would likewise provide a bright and soft impression.
